### 2026-06-11 — Phase 4 complete
- Play UI components: `GameSetupForm`, `JeopardyBoard`, `CluePanel`, `BuzzPanel`, `Scoreboard`, `GameComplete`.

- Pure game engine in `src/game/engine.ts` (createGame, selectClue, openBuzz, buzz, judgeAnswer).

### 2026-06-11 — Phase 2 complete
- Dev-server JSON API for board and saved-game files; typed validation in `loadBoard.ts`.
- Seeded 6×5 sample board; Play Game view loads and displays categories or a friendly error.
